## overview
In this project, I implemented the popular mobile game Doodle Jump using MIPS assembly. If you don't have access to physical computers with MIPS processors, you can test the implementation in a simulated environment within MARS, i.e., a simulated bitmap display and a simulated
keyboard input.
## How to Play
The goal of this game is to see how high the Doodler can get by jumping up from platform to platform. The camera follows the Doodler as it jumps to higher platforms, with new platforms appearing at the top of the screen. The game ends if
the Doodler misses the platforms and lands on the bottom edge of the screen.
